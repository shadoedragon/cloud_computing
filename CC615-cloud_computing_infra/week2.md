## Virtual Servers

The data center is controlled by a software management system, which keeps track of all the infrastructure elements and can invoke various operations on them.

The servers in the racks provide the main cloud infrastructure element, commonly called "Compute", which delivers computational power for cloud customers.

### Virtual Server Implementation

Virtualization is a technique allowing computers to emulate other computers as well as various hardware devices.

For server virtualization, __hypervisor__ software can create multiple copies of the emulated (virtual) machines on the host server, and manage them. Each virtual server can run its own (guest) operating system.

The hypervisor can substitute for the host's operating system, or run on top of it.
