# Cloud Adoption

## Key statements

- Cloud Computing has been forecast to be one of the biggest shifts in IT for the last 20 years, although this may seem like an outrageous claim, many experts share the same view.
- Some forecasts claim most organizations will be running entirely in the cloud in the next decade.
- A 'cloud first' policy means that all ICT procurement initiatives should consider cloud first.

The roles of governments in the cloud can include
- User
- Service provider
- Regulator
- Promoter

Challenges to governments moving to the cloud include:
- Lack of expertise in acquisition, migration, and cloud management
- Security and privacy issues
- Quality of network of infrastructure
- Allocating sufficient implementation funds


## Innovation Adoption Curve

- The adoption curve models how innovation is adopted over time.
- The Chasm is a phase in the innovation adoption curve where adoption stall, then either jumps or fades away.
- It's at this point where the innovation 'sinks or swims'.
- The Chasm is the gap between the early adopters and the early majority. If there is enough momentum built up by the early adopters, then the innovation will jump the chasm and the early majority will adopt the new innovation. If there is not enough momentum, the innovation will stall and gradually fade away.
- An innovation has to cross the Chasm in the adoption curve in order to become mainstream in the market.

## Regarding "Requirements"

- When forming requirement, early mistakes can be costly to repair later
- When should we form a requirements baseline? Before the contract is agreed to.
