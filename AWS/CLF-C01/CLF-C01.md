## Overview

### AWS Cloud Computing

- Cloud Computing is the on-demand delivery of compute power, database storage, applications, and other IT resources through a cloud services platform via the internet with pay-as-you-go pricing
- AWS Cloud Services Platform provides rapid access to flexible and low cost IT resources
- Pay-as-you-go pricing? Pay only for what you use, when you use it !
- 3 major serivce model: IaaS, PaaS, SaaS, the differences between them are Functionalityand Tasks' Ownership & Flexibility
- Deployment Model

	- On-Premises, also known as Private Cloud

		- Resources are deployed in your on-premises DC, using virtualization and resource management tools - VMWare, Hyper-V, OpenStack
		- Offters the ability to provide dedicated resources, not split between users or end customers (only your Apps sit on the actual hardware)
		- You have full control over your infrastructure and are responsibile for management and OS patching

	- Hybrid

		- Can be an intermediate step, whiel you are on the way to fully migrating to the AWS cloud
		- a way to connect infra and apps between cloud-based resources and existing resources that are not located in the cloud
		- The most common method of hybrid deployment is between the cloud and your existing on-premises infra in order to extend or grow your organizations' infra

	- Cloud

		- application is fully deployed in the cloud and all components of the application run in the cloud
		- Applications in the cloud have either been created in the cloud or have been migrated from an existing infra to take advantage of the cloud benefits
		- Migrating an App from on-prem to cloud is typically called "lift-and-shift"; this refers to taking the App as is, without modifying it, and running it on cloud-native resources

### 6 Advantages of AWS Cloud Computing

- 1) Trade capital expense for variable expense

	- You can now pay only when you consume computing resources, and pay only for how much you consume
	- No upfront commitment "pay-as-you-use"

- 2) Benefit from massive economies of scale

  Economies of Scale means:
  Buy in Bulk
  Efficient Porduction
  Spread Risk
  Reduction in Promotion Costs
  Cheaper Capital
  Reduction in Logistics Costs

	- You can achieve a lower variable cost than you can get on your own
	- Because usage from hundreds of thousands of customers is aggregated in the cloud, providers such as AWS can achieve higher economies of scale, which translates into lower pay-as-you-go prices

- 3) Stop guessing about capacity
- 4) Increase speed and agility
- 5) Stop spending money running and maintaining DCs
- 6) Go global in minutes
