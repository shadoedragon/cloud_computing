## 1. Introduction

### What is Kubernetes

- Kubernetes is an open source orchestrator for deploying containerized applications.
- Kubernetes was originally developed by Google, inspired by a decade of experience deploying scalable, reliable systems in containers via application-oriented APIs.
- Kubernetes provides the software necessary to successfully build and deploy reliable, scalable ditributed systems.

	- Distributed System
	- Reliable
	- Availiability
	- Scalable

### Reason of using containers and container APIs like Kubernetes

- Velocity

	- The difference between you and your competitors is often the speed with which you can develop and deploy new components and features
	- Velocity is measured not in terms of the raw number of features you can ship per hour or day, but rather in terms of the number of things you can ship while maintaining a highly available service
	- Container and Kubernetes can provide the tools that you need to move quickly, while staying available. The core concepts that enable this are immutability, declarative configuration, and online self-healing systems.

- Scaling (of both software and teams)
- Abstracting your infrastructure
- Efficiency
