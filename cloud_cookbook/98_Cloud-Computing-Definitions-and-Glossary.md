The identity of persons who handle evidence between the time of commission of the alleged offense and the ultimate disposition of the cae. It is the responsibility of each transferee to ensure that the items are accounted for during the time they are in his possession, that they are properly protected, and that there is a record of the names of the persons from whom he received the items and to whom he delivered those items, together with the time and date of such receipt and delivery. |
|          |                                                    | 2. The control over evidence. Lack of control over evidence can lead to its being discredited completely. Chain of custody depends on being able to verify that evidence could not have been tampered with. This is accomplished by sealing off the evidence so that it connot in any way be changed and providing a documentary record of custody to prove that the evidence was at all times under strict control and not subject to tampering.                                                             |
