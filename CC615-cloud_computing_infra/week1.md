## Cloud Computing Definition

Cloud Computing refers to the creation and use of remote virtual servers or other devices over the internet instead of local servers or devices.

NIST definition:

Cloud computing is a model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g. networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) which can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction (Mell & Grance, 2011)
