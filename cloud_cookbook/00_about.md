# About the Cloud Cookbook

These days, working in several projects that may have the cloud computing options, and also got chance learnt quite many regulatory guidelines on cloud computing, feels it is necessary to organize the thinking approach into one streamline "book" to describe the practical adoption methodology for going to cloud.

Also wish to welcome everyone that interests in Cloud Computing field to contribute and input your knowledge and experience, so that we can together to make one brilliant Cookbook and bring values to others.

Thanks in advance!
