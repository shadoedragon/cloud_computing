# CCSP Domain 1 - Arch Concepts and Design Req

## Domain Objectives

CCSP needs an understanding of cloud computing concepts such as definitions based on the ISO/IEC 17788 standard.

### Define the various roles, characteristics, and technologies as they relate to cloud computing concepts

### Describe cloud computing concepts as they relate to cloud computing activities, capabilities, categories, models, and cross-cutting aspects

### Identify the design principles necessary for secure cloud computing

### Define the various design principles for the different types of cloud categories

### Describe the design principles for secure cloud computing

### Identify criteria specific to national, international, and industry for certifying trusted cloud services

### Identify criteria specific to the system and subsystem product certification

## 01. Cloud Introduction

### Cloud Definition: (NIST): cloud computing is a model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, stroage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management efforts or service provider interaction.

### Cloud Computing Overview

### CSP vs. MSP

- CSP: Cloud Service Provider
- MSP: Managed Service Provider

### Drivers for Cloud Computing

- Cost associated with the ownership of current IT infrastructure solutions as well as projected costs to continue to maintain these solutions years in and year out

	- from Captial Expenditure (CapEx) (e.g., buildings, computer equipment) to Operational Expenditure (OpEx) (e.g., utility costs, maintenance)

- The desire to reduce IT complexity

	- Risk Reduction

		- Users can use the cloud to test ideas and concepts before making major investments in technology

	- Scalability

		- Users have access to a large number of resources that scale based on user demand

	- Elasticity

		- The environment transparently manages a user's resource utilization based on dynamically changing needs

- Comsumption-based Pricing

	- Virtualization

		- Each users has a single view of the available resources, independent of their arrangement in terms of physical devices

	- Cost

		- The pay-per-usage model allows an organization to pay only for the resources it needs with basically no investment in the physical resources available in the cloud.
		- There are no infrastructure maintenance or upgrade costs

- Business Agility

	- Mobility

		- Users can access data and applications from around the globe

	- Collaboration and Innovation

		- Users are starting to see the cloud as a way to work simultaneously on common data and information

### Security, Risks and Benefits

- Distributed Multitenant Security Environment

	- Business Ecosystem

- Risks

	- Business
	- Reputation

		- Strategic alignment

			- Effective board oversight
			- Integration of risk into strategy setting and business planning

		- Cultural alignment

			- Strong corporate values and a focus on compliance

		- Operational focus

			- Strong control environment

- Compliance

	- Legal
	- Regulatory

- Privacy
